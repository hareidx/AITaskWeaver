Please create four separate prioritized lists for the following tasks based on urgency, importance, deadline, and duration:

- touch up paint in the bathroom: urgency = low, duration = 60 minutes, importance = low, deadline = not applicable

- feed the fish: urgency = medium, duration = 10 minutes, importance = high, deadline = tomorrow

>>> [THOUGHT]
ProgramApe will create a Python code snippet to sort the tasks based on the given criteria: urgency, importance, deadline, and duration. Since the deadline for 'touch up paint in the bathroom' is not applicable, it will be handled differently in the sorting process.
>>> [PYTHON]
# Define the tasks and their associated criteria
tasks = {
    'clean the bathroom': {'urgency': 'low', 'duration': 30, 'importance': 'low', 'deadline': 'tomorrow'},

    'complete my taxes': {'urgency': 'low', 'duration': 120, 'importance': 'high', 'deadline': '2 weeks away'},
    'feed the fish': {'urgency': 'medium', 'duration': 10, 'importance': 'high', 'deadline': 'tomorrow'}
}

# Define a function to sort tasks based on a given criterion
def sort_tasks(tasks, criterion, reverse=False):
    return sorted(tasks, key=lambda task: (tasks[task][criterion] is None, tasks[task][criterion]), reverse=reverse)

# Create prioritized lists
urgency_list = sort_tasks(tasks, 'urgency', reverse=True)
importance_list = sort_tasks(tasks, 'importance', reverse=True)
deadline_list = sort_tasks(tasks, 'deadline')
duration_list = sort_tasks(tasks, 'duration')

# Put all the result variables in the last line of the code
(urgency_list, importance_list, deadline_list, duration_list)
>>> [VERIFICATION]
NONE

SUCCESS
